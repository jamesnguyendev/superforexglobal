            SuperForex dedicates its keen attention to tracking suspicious and
            significant transaction activities, and reports such activities
            along with comprehensive information to the relevant law enforcement
            bodies. To maintain the integrity of reporting systems and to
            safeguard businesses, the legislative framework provides legal

            A key step to preventing and discouraging money laundering using our
            platforms is the fact that SuperForex does not accept cash deposits.
            SuperForex has the right to refuse to process a transfer at any
            stage where it believes the transfer to be connected in any way to
            money laundering or criminal activity. SuperForex cannot inform
            customers that they have been reported for suspicious activity.
