    "affiliateLinkDescription": "Affiliate links are arguably the most important detail in our Partnership Program. This is a code unique to every partner, which comprises the end of all URLs you would be using to redirect possible clients to the SuperForex main website. Our servers use these affiliate links to record the clients you successfully attract to SuperForex - all customers who open live accounts and make at least one deposit after using your unique link are your referrals. The cookies that go with each affiliate code last up to 12 months, which means that if someone decides to open an account a year after they have used your code, they will still become a part of your affiliate group.",
    "howToUse": "How do you use it?",
    "howToUseDescription": "The affiliate code is granted to you when you register as a partner, and it looks something like “ABCD.” This code must be placed at the end of all of your links in order to utilize its function to record clients. It is up to you to decide where the links may lead - it can be any page on our main website or even the Client’s Cabinet. For example, if a partner who has an affiliate code “ABCD” wishes to redirect clients to the homepage of the Client’s Cabinet, then they will use the link “my.superforex.com/?x=ABCD” to affiliate the clients who follow it.",

This would allow you to differentiate between your links and customize them in a way that helps you put them to different purpose, for instance, using different codes on your blog, favorite forum, or social networks - you would then be able to see the traffic for each link and determine which resource brings you the most traffic. When you identify your most profitable outlet you can optimize your marketing strategies for maximum impact.",
    "customAffiliateLinkDescription3": "Full statistics about each unique custom affiliate code you use (as well as the original one you receive from us upon registration) are available in the Partner’s Cabinet.

You can specify the amount of rebate in pips that you are willing to share, and then this would automatically be sent to your affiliate clients when you earn commission from their trades. This creates a healthy cycle of exchange: your clients trade, generating commission for you; you share back a part of your earnings with your clients, helping them to trade more, creating more commission for you, and so on. This is good for motivating your existing clients, but it can also be a deciding factor for a client looking to join an affiliate group - they are likely to favor a partner who shares their earnings through a rebate system rather than one who does not. Overall, you will be able to enjoy higher profits and your clients will be happier.",
